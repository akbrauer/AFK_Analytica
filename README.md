# AFK_Analytica
A variety of components developed to assist my friend Jordan Endres (/inSeas0n) in launching his AFK Arena / AFK Journey gaming fansite AFK Analytica. He reached out to me while I was just beginning to learn Javascript to design small components for him to embed into his Google Sites hosted templates. These provided simple pieces of functionality to get the site off the ground, and have mostly since been replace as a more professional development team has taken over.

The site is now located at Analytica.gg, built using Next.js & Tailwind, the repository for which can be found here https://github.com/kmontag42/afk-journey-team-builder.
